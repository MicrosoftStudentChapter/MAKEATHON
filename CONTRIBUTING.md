## Dev Environment Details
### Advice for new contributors
Start small. The PRs most likely to be merged are the ones that make small, easily reviewed changes with clear and specific intentions.

It's a good idea to gauge interest in your intended work by finding the current issue for it or creating a new one yourself.Once you've spent a little bit of time planning your solution, it's a good idea to go back to the issue and talk about your approach.
### Developer Setup
First, you'll need [Python ](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-391/ "Python version 3.9.1") which matches our current version i.e. 3.9.1.
Secondly, you'll need [Django](https://pypi.org/project/Django/ "Django").

Then you need git, if you don't have that yet, you can go to: [git](https://git-scm.com/ "git").




## How to Submit Changes
1. #### The First Step
  - First things first, fork the MAKEATHON [repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftStudentChapter/MAKEATHON) into your own Github account, and create a local clone of it. This will be used to implement new features and fix bugs.
  - Open this local repository on your personal computer and start implementing.
  - UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE DON'T WORK DIRECTLY ON THE MASTER BRANCH, but create a separate branch for each issue you are working on. That way you can easily switch between different work, and you can update each one for latest changes on upstream master individually
2. #### The Second Step
  - Go to the original remote repository and checkout the [issues tab](https://github.com/MicrosoftStudentChapter/MAKEATHON/issues) and comment on the issue want to work on.
  - The issues will be assigned on first request basis by a maintainer.
3. #### The Third Step
  - Once all the changes have been made, generate a pull request(PR) and add at least one of the Maintainers as a Reviewer for the same.
  - When the Reviewer fully accepts the features or the issue is fully resolved your branch will be merged with the master branch.
4. #### IMPORTANT GUIDLINES
  -  Prettier for HTML, CSS, JS files.
  -  Set Tab-width: 4
  -  Indent inner HTML code.
  -  Follow PEP guidelines.

5. #### Other Important Points
  - Write meaning commit messages, briefly detailing whatever changes you have done or added.
  - It is important that you link the concerned issue with the pull request (In the description of your PR write "This fixes #).
